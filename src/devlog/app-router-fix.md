# App Router to Pages Router Migration

## Issue
When running the development server, we encountered the following error:
```
Error: Conflicting app and page file was found, please remove the conflicting files to continue:
  "src\pages\index.tsx" - "src\app\page.tsx"
```

## Root Cause
The project was initially created with the App Router (`--app` flag in create-next-app), but our design document specified using the Pages Router for simplicity. This created a conflict between the two routing systems.

## Solution
We resolved the issue by removing the App Router files:
```
rm -r src\app
```

This eliminated the conflict and allowed the Pages Router implementation to work correctly.

## Benefits of Pages Router for this Project
1. Simpler routing model for a small application
2. More straightforward file structure
3. Easier to understand for developers new to Next.js
4. Matches the design document specifications

## Next Steps
- Continue testing the application functionality
- Ensure all components work correctly
- Prepare for deployment to Vercel
