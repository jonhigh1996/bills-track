# Styling Fix for Simple Bill Tracker

## Issue
We encountered issues with Tailwind CSS configuration in our project. The error was related to incompatible Tailwind CSS imports:

```
Error: Package path ./base is not exported from package C:\Users\Boone Voyage\Documents\RealVSCode\billtracker\node_modules\tailwindcss
```

## Root Cause
The project was created with Tailwind CSS v4, but our CSS imports were using syntax that wasn't compatible with this version.

## Solution
We replaced the Tailwind CSS directives with custom CSS utility classes that mimic Tailwind's functionality. This approach:

1. Eliminates dependency on Tailwind's preprocessing directives
2. Provides the same utility classes we need for our components
3. Avoids compatibility issues with different Tailwind versions

## Implementation
We created a comprehensive set of utility classes in `globals.css` that include:

- Layout utilities (flex, grid, spacing)
- Typography (font sizes, weights, colors)
- Colors and backgrounds
- Borders and shadows
- Responsive design utilities

## Benefits
1. No dependency on Tailwind's preprocessing pipeline
2. Faster build times
3. Full control over the CSS
4. No compatibility issues between different versions

## Next Steps
- Continue testing the application functionality
- Ensure all components work correctly with the custom CSS
- Add more utility classes as needed
- Prepare for deployment to Vercel
